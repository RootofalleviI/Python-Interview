""" Write a program which prints a sequence of operations that transfers n rings from one peg to another.
You have a third peg, which is initially empty. The only operation you can perform is takin a single ring
from the top of one peg and placing it on the top of another peg. You must never place a larger ring above
a smaller ring. """
